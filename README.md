# PayUp App â€” Principle Prototype (Motion Study)

## What is PayUp?

PayUp is a mobile app to manage shared expenses, receive and pay debts, without the need to expose banking information. All you need is a mobile phone number.

The project was developed with LÃ­lia Correia and Marta Casal, under a Postgraduate Diploma in Digital Experience Design.

> Our goal in creating PayUp is to help Millennials solve problems with splitting and tracking shared expenses, collecting and paying off debts among friends, by developing a mobile app that is better than MB WAY, Verse and Splitwise because it integrates into a single product the possibility to send and receive instant payments at any time, in a fast and easy way, without the need to disclose banking information, as well as track shared expenses. (Elevator Pitch)

Even though all team members were involved in all project phases, we each chose a main user flow to work on. I was responsible for designing the flow to **create a group to share expenses and add an expense to that group** in two modes:

1. Walkthrough mode (conversational design)
2. Power User mode (chatbot)

## Prototype

I used Principle to emulate the micro-interactions in a more organic way and explore how motion could be implemented in PayUp's app. This helped me grasp the app's flow and functionality on a deeper level.

Given time constraints, I only prototyped (in Principle) the flow I worked on in walkthrough mode.

**Userflow to create a group and add an expense â€” Walkthrough mode:**

*	Login with Email and Password;
*	Access Bot;
*	Create a Group to share expenses with Ana Sousa and Catarina Maia (select Ana Sousa from the list and search for Catarina Maia);
*	Add an Expense to that Group;
* Go back to the Home Screen.
